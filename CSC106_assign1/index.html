    <h1>Welcome to Cristian's Programming Porfolio</h1> 
    This is my porfolio webpage that I programmed in HTML and CSS. <p>
    It has many of the programs that I wrote in the course.<p>
    This website is going to have my JavaScrips and future projects that I work on.<br>  
    It will also contain an about me page where you can find fun facts about me and a breif description of who I am.<br>
    It currently has a csc banner and working Home,Javascrips and an About me page, will eventually have more to it.</P>
